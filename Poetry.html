                <b> Poem 1 </b> <br>
                <p style="padding-right: 100px; padding-left: 100px; line-height: 2;"> Lovers take time<br>
                Time is greater than distance <br>
                Distance is but a perpetual precautionary self defense mechanism <br>
                <NOBR>Mechanism like my heart: a beating contraption whose pumping I have yet to find an off switch for </NOBR><br>
                For you to laugh when you can’t swim is for me to wish nails could carve through cement <br>
                Cement weaker than the glass walls you build around the reality of hunger<br>
                <NOBR>Hunger for oceans to sink and ship wrecks to float as if there were never any wars at our seas </NOBR><br>
                Seas swallowing footsteps on the shores of your already limited fantasies<br>
                Fantasies that we dreamt of when younger were once perriwinkle <br>
                Periwinkle like the shade of convincing ourselves that we can meld pebbles into planets <br>
                <NOBR style="margin-left: -40px;">Planets stand in between us but we still shove universes down our throats and regurgitate it into each other </NOBR><br>
                <NOBR> Other people would not understand the determination to keep my hand folded in your palms </NOBR><br>
                Palms of terror festering under my skin <br>
                Skin is supposed to be soft so don’t ask me why mine isn’t <br>
                Isn’t wonderful to get answers to your questions <br>
                <NOBR style="margin-left: -90px;">Questions only dig ravines into our conversations when I bite honesty into my cheek and drain the blood from my blush </NOBR><br>
                Blush is a pretty shade on you that I’m glad I can paint for distraction <br>
                <NOBR style="margin-left: -95px;"> Distraction is the sweetest salvation, recovery from fights we never had, that sugary flavor in the back of our tongues </NOBR><br>
                Tongues drooping past our chins, we are exhausted from drooling lies
 </p><br></div>

                  Brewing coffee in the garden of eden <br>
                  Slowly stirred with milk from cattle we raised beforehand <br>
                  The cream felt heavenly on our tongues as we drank our confessions <br style="line-height: 4;">
                  Holiness was not what we were scavenging for <br>
                  We simply considered each other distracting <br>
                  Love is momentary anyways <br style="line-height: 4;">
                  And later vineyard grapes would sour sweet words <br>
                  Sip tasteless wine after caffeine <br>
                  <NOBR> Energy from yesterday morning finally shatters and we blame the other one for dropping it </NOBR><br>
                  Shards of euphoric reluctance on the ground and we wait to see who sweeps it up <br style="line-height: 4;">
                  Pigeons flutter past rusted metal fences <br>
                  We dreamt clandestine alleys were worlds that slipped through God’s fingertips <br>
                  Yet only humanity’s eyes etched embarrassment onto our sins

                  Beauty is only sufficient if it is elastic <br>
                  Look dazzling when you cry <br>
                  Anger needs to have a glimmer to it <br>
                  Anxiety should be dressed elegantly <br>
                  Fear needs to stunning, but in a subtle way <br>
                  Pain is gorgeous, blindingly <br>
                  Sleepless nights are alluring <br>
                  Bite marks on your lips are decorative <br>
                  Turn flushed skin into a delicate blush <br>
                  Paint your nails with any dismay received <br>
                  Embarrassment must be worn proudly <br>
                  After all, it’s custom made <br>
                  The crashing sound of the divergence between your eye color in summer’s child and the words you cut your tongue with needs to be melodic  <br>
                  The shades of your skin need to shine alongside stars <br>
                  The darkened patches beneath your eyes need to be comforting <br>

                  Sipping from broken glasses  <br>
                  Filling Sunday mornings with the smell of split lips <br>
                  Honesty tars you darling  <br>
                  Puncture you like paper and you crumple in my hands  <br>

                  Anticipation heals idealism as if they’re open cuts  <br>
                  Ink stains of distorted regrets spilling through fabric  <br>
                  Infectious exposure traced back to self dialogue  <br>
                  I’m choking over blame I haven’t built  <br>

                  Double tonguing I love yous <br>
                  Overlapping declarations blurring into misunderstandings <br>
                  I’m brewing frustration over still stares <br>
                  Flush my fears down your throat <br>
                  Clean my wounds with consolidation <br>
                  Kiss the shards on the floors we’re tiptoeing on <br>
                  I’m craving numbness and you’re keeping me starved <br>
 </p></div>
            <div style="background-color: #23202A; padding: 40px; margin-bottom: 50px;"><p style="display: inline-block; padding-right: 100px; padding-left: 100px; line-height: 2;"><b> Poem 5 </b> <br> 
                  I’m trying to convey to you my reasoning <br>
                  But my tongue’s twisting yields no results <br>
                  I talk through wanting <br>
                  Listen to the way my hands sadly trace your skin <br>
                  Fingertips mumbling white lies <br>
 </p></div>

                  Overreaction overflowing in my direction <br>
                  Breathing through scarce air bubbles <br>
                  It’s secure to you how blame is cancerous and you’re blissfully immune <br>
                  Hanging me by the rope of my crumbling stability <br>
                  Yet I’ll only learn to be responsive through resurrection <br>
                  Crucify the cracks in my voice but it’s when the wood is rotting that my remorse thins out <br>
 </p></div>

                I am standing on the coast <br>
                Slowly deepening my toes into the damp shore, <br>
                My arms totter like the branches of a sapling being bullied by the winds <br>
                I promise, I’d scream for your name, but the sand settles down my throat oh so easily and weighs my vocals down into the pit of my stomach <br>
                I can feel it thinning in the acid <br>
                It’s terrifying to say I love you from afar anyways <br>
                I am standing on the coast <br>
                I sharpen my vision to see you - not too far away <br>
                Not too far away, but a universe fills in the space between us <br>
                Only miles apart, I can feel your breath whisper past the tip of my ears, but the distance is perpetual <br>
                You’re so close, cradling me away, but the obsidian riptides will chase your ankles and grab your shins to tear you back  <br>
                I stretch my forearm across the ocean, let it graze the sea salt  <br>
                The waves flap over my inner elbow weighing my shoulders down and I can feel planets on my fingertips  <br>
                Stardust gets trapped underneath my nails <br>
                 There is a solar system in between us  <br>
                I am standing on the coast  <br>
                You are light years away, but I can almost embrace you and tell you that you have flown to me and that you will stay  <br>
                I am safe and sound on the coast where I will always be warm  <br>
                I am sunbathing on the coast and the sun shines here more than people understand  <br>
                I watch this world take for granted how soft sand can be compared to the gravel that you are held on barefoot  <br>
                I am standing on the coast, and no matter how far you’ll sail, how much you’ll kiss the shore when you arrive, and how long you’ll stay in the sun, you will always be tied to an infinity away  <br>
                I was born on this coast, where I will always be waiting  <br>
                And I could only ever love half of you <br>
                But you’ll be standing on that damn coast <br>
                Coming  <br>
                but you'll never be leaving
